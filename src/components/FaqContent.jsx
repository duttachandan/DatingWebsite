              Advantages &amp; Disadvantages of online dating
            </h3>

            <p>
              Like traditional dating, Indian online dating also has its
              associated pros and cons.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl text-[#db147b] font-bold font-serif">Advantages</h3>

            <p>
              Meeting people existing outside social networks where they would
              otherwise never meet
            </p>

            <p>
              Meeting more people quicker with similar core values, faith,
              interests, background and preferences
            </p>

            <p>
              Offers privacy and confidentiality (turns out now this is not
              necessarily true)
            </p>

            <p>More convenient than other ways of trying to meet people</p>

            <p>Safer than many other conventional dating methods</p>

            <p>
              The advantage to ‘scientific’ online dating isn’t to come up with
              some foolproof formula for romantic connection, but it can offer a
              safeguard to prevent you from making a poor choice.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl text-[#db147b] font-bold font-serif">Disadvantages</h3>

            <p>People lie about themselves.</p>

            <p>
              Users hide information about themselves and one cannot know for
              certain someone’s true character. They may not tell things about
              them you need to know.
            </p>

            <p>
              Geographical distance makes physical closeness difficult, if not
              impossible.
            </p>

            <p>Increased potential for identity theft.</p>

            <p>
              The speed of the online relationship cannot ensure you’re seeing a
              person for who they really are and all you need to know about
              someone’s past experiences.
            </p>

            <p>
              Wasted resources.&nbsp; A third of all online dating users have
              never met anyone face to face as a result of their time, efforts
              and money.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl text-[#db147b] font-bold font-serif">Why you should choose Romancedelight?</h3>

            <h3 className="text-2xl text-[#db147b] font-bold font-serif">Online Dating Safety</h3>

            <p>
              Online dating websites have become a leading way for people to
              find their next romance. But, as with any interactions online,
              whether it's buying and selling items, social media accounts or
              even banking, users need to understand the risks that can be
              associated with online dating.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl text-[#db147b] font-bold font-serif">When it's online:</h3>

            <p>
              At the beginning, keep the personal details that you share to a
              minimum
            </p>

            <p>Don’t use your real name as your username</p>

            <p>
              Don’t reveal details about where you live, work, or places you’ll
              be going
            </p>

            <p>
              Message over the app or website instead of giving out your
              personal phone number.
            </p>

            <p>
              Do not share images if you don’t feel comfortable with them being
              public
            </p>

            <p>
              Remember that people are not always who they say are. If you are
              suspicious of someone report them to the website.
            </p>

            <p>
              Do not feel pressured to meet someone if you aren’t comfortable.
            </p>

            <p>
              Look in to a person’s online presence. If they have other social
              media accounts, be sure the details of these accounts match up
              with what they have told you about themselves. Ask yourself
              questions- do they have the social media presence you would
              expect?
